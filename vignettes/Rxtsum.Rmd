# A few words about Rxtsum

The package Rxtsum replicates the between/within standard deviation decomposition of Stata's xtsum package. In particular, it follows the procedure described here : http://stephenporter.org/files/xtsum_handout.pdf

It is used as follows:
```
Rxtsum(data, id, col)
```
Where data is a dataframe which can be grouped (for example panel data where the group is the individual), id is the grouping variable, and col is a character vector for which you want the within/between decomposition. Obviously, col have to be numeric.
